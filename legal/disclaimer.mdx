## Meditations

Meditation is usually considered a safe activity. However, as one progresses and explores more of the in depth/advanced techniques you may encounter things
that can recall certain memories or sensations that might be uncomfortable or in some rare cases, trigger unwanted effects.

We ask that you don't jump into any advanced meditations and to enjoy the journey as a beginner as well as learning the correct
tools along the way.

If you have a history of mental illness, then please consult with your health care provider before trying any of the meditations on this site.

Please be aware that we make no claim to be any kind of psychologist, therapist, counselor or medical professional. Anything on our site is the creators own opinion and not an expression of professional advice or prescription. 

We can't accept any responsibility for any adverse affects, direct or indirect, that may result from your use of the information or context on this website. Furthermore, we make no guarantees that any of the information or practices on this website and guided meditations will function in any particular way for you. By using this website and guided meditations, you agree that you use the information contained herein entirely at your own discretion.

## Other

Although other articles (such as audio books or journeys) don't require any medical recommendations it's worth noting again that it is a community 
based portal, which means that certain recordings might be uncomfortably loud or don't reflect the actual content. In that case please just notify us
with the URL and we'll make sure to remedy the issue as quickly as possible.
