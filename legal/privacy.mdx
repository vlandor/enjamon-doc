<Title title="User Privacy" />

User privacy is important, and we only gather information for metrics, product development or to store on behalf of the user.

## Data Gathering 

### Users

* Their views, including :
    - the combination of narrations, sounds, images and language
    - whether the view was completed, if not what sentence they left at
    - if a journey, which route they took

* Their verbal and biometric data

User data are not shared with anyone else, and can't be accessed by any other being on platform unless explicitly shared.

* Anonymous analytics, such as their country and browser.

### Creators

* All the data required to create an article or journey

## Machine Learning

One goal of Enjamon is to try and gather data to teach computers how to better understand languages. We can do so by passing audio of sentences and their transcribed part. This part is purely anonymous and users can opt-in or out at any point.

We may also in the future start doing some data analysis againt things like the correlation of certain words and a users pulse on a large sample size. This again will be something that by default is opt-out

## Encryption at rest

We store all our information in an encrypted database and file storage. In order for a user to listen to their journal (or anything that was published with a private setting) they first need to pass a permission firewall to verify they can access it.

## Local storage

We save verbal data on the users' device while something is being journaled, so if a user was halfway through a recording and closes the browser this will leave a fingerprint.
