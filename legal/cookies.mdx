A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page
server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in
the domain that issued the cookie to you. Some of the cookies will only be
used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some
cookies will always be used. You can find out more about each cookie by
viewing our current cookie list below. We update this list quarterly, so there
may be additional cookies that are not yet listed. Web beacons, tags and
scripts may be used in the Websites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies,
count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine
whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports
based on the use of these technologies by our service/analytics providers on
an individual and aggregated basis.
