#Â Provide users an archive of all their previous views and experiences

The ability to provide the user detailed information about their experience is one of the  (core pillars)[./enjamon-pillars]. Within the current versions we support both capturing the users pulse and recording audio responses, with more in the works.

## Recording responses 

### Verbal Responses

An audio response is the ability for a user to reply to a question verbally within a document (for usecases such as [gratitude journal]() or [user research]() or to just describe what they see during something like a [shamanic journey]()

In order to enable audio journaling, the following steps need to be taken:

1) Login
2) Enable audio journaling and providing the browser permission to use the microphone

** Caveat: Currently using bluetooth devices such as the AirPods switch to a low quality audio mode when the microphone is turned on.

### Pulse Association

The pulse plugin allows to monitor your pulse throughout any playback and log your pulse and oxygen levels at each sentence. This allows you to have deeper insights into how well a meditation might work, or how scared you got when listening to a suspenseful article. These sort of bio metrics could eventually provide you deeper insights into which types of words and types of meditations work best, and how the person you are today might have differed to the person you were weeks ago.

## Viewing responses

In order to view a response, you can go to any article you have previously visited and select a view you have had recently. A whole user UI to monitor their past views is currently in the works.
