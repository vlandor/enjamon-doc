## Adding an image

1. Select an image to use within your article. This could be out of the selection of images from the [Image Gallery](./image-gallery) or by directly uploading a picture to Enjamon.
2. The image is now available within the background iamges grid, which means you can use it 
on any of the paragraphs within your article. In this section you can edit the name of the image, associate a color to it to help visualise it within the Editor and set whether it is the default image to use if a paragraph does not have a specific image selected.
3. Click on the side bar on any paragraph and select which image should be used for that paragrah

And that's it, if you want to see the Images play through the book you can preview the Article within the [preview mode](./preview-mode).
