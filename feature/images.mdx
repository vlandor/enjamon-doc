# Add images to any document

Enjamon allows you to add images to different paragraphs, turning an audiobook 
into an illustrated book by simply adding images to your project and selecting
the image to use for each paragraphs.

The steps needed to add an image are:

1) Select an image to use within your article. This could be out of the selection of images from the [Image Gallery](./image-gallery) or by directly uploading a picture to Enjamon.

2) The image is now available within the background iamges grid, which means you can use it 
on any of the paragraphs within your article. In this section you can edit the name of the image, associate a color to it to help visualise it within the Editor and set whether it is the default image to use if a paragraph does not have a specific image selected.

3) Click on the side bar on nay paragraph and select which image should be used for that paragrah.

And that's it, if you want to see the Images play through the book you can preview the Article within the [preview mode](./preview-mode).
