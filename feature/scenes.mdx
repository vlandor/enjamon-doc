A scene is an article that can be inserted into any journey. To create a scene you follow the same steps as an article:

- create a scene
- write
- narrate
- sounds
- images
- publish

Once published, you can then import the scene into any of your journeys, allowing you to reuse common templates multiple times.

Each scene can also have multiple narrators, sound profiles and image profiles, allowing creators to select which ones work best for their specific journey.

You also have the option of publishing it publicly. A public scene means other creators can find it within the scene library, speeding up their journey development.
