### Background sounds

Enjamon allows you to label any paragraph with a looped sound, allowing you to add audio context with the click of a button.

## The steps needed to add a background sound are:

1. Click on Background Sounds in the editor.
2. Select a looped sound to use. This could be out of the selection of public and private sounds from the [Sound Gallery](./sound-gallery) or by directly uploading a sound to Enjamon.
3. The image sound is now available within the sounds grid, which means you can use it on any of the paragraphs within your article. In this section you can edit the name of the sound, associate a color to it to help visualise it within the Editor and set whether it is the default sound to use if a paragraph does not have a specific one selected.
4. Click on the side bar on any paragraph and select which sound should be used for that paragrah.

### Foregound sounds

Each sentence can be followed by a custom sequence of sounds, optionally adding silence between them when needed. All the sounds and durations are visualized within the sentences themselves. Copy the sentence around and watch as the sounds are copied along side with it. Delete the sentence and they dissapear.

## The steps needed to add a background sound are:

1. Click on any marker between two sentences.
2. Add either a sound or a duration to the marker. You can chain multiple sounds together, but can only have one duration between two sounds. 
3. When adding a sound, simply click on one from the Sound Grid and its added to the your story.

And that's it, if you want to hear the sounds play through the book you can preview the Article within the [preview mode](./preview-mode).
