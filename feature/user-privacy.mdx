<Title title="User Privacy" />

User privacy is important, and we only gather information for metrics or to store on behalf of the user.

### The data that we currently gather from users are:

1) Their views, including :
    - the combination of narrations, sounds, images and language
    - whether the view was completed
    - if a journey, which route they took

2) Their recordings, (opt in). These recordings are not shared with anyone else, and can't be accessed by anyone other than the user and ourselves (which we do not do).

3) Their pulse rate (opt in). There metrics are not shared with anyone else.

### Encryption at rest

We store all our information in an encrypted database and file storage. In order for a user to listen to their journal (or anything that was published with a private setting) they first need to request a signed URL from the server which would permission them to load the file.

### Local storage

We do save verbal data on the users device while something is being journaled, so if a user was halfway through a recording and closes the browser this will leave a fingerprint in the browser.
