Allowing users to fully customize their experience is a [core pillar](./enjamon-pillars) of Enjamon.

## The user has the options to mix and match

### The Language

Enjamon provides the ability for content creators and the wider community to [translate](./translate) any public article to any other language. Not only specifying the language itself but also the locale. Looking for a meditation that is in Arabic? What about one that uses the Egyptian dialect?

### The Narrator

The difference a narrators voice makes within any audio experience seems to be pretty clear. If you find a narrators voice unfitting it's likely you won't go through the entire article. If doing a meditation it's probably even less likely. That's why Enjamon provides the ability for you to pick from a range of narrators, giving the option to pick one that suits you most.

### The Sound Profile

Words can transport users to entirely different dimensions, but sounds can help paint those dimensions in vibrant colours. Listen to a meditation with the sound of an waterfall in the background, the sounds of birds at dawn in a forest, or mesmerizing tribal drums. 

The changes could be even more subtle. Create different sound profiles with the same background sounds, but the creak of the floor board might be more subtle, the silences between sounds more suspenseful, and the big reveal more likely to get you jumping out of your skin.

### The Images

Looking at an old childrens illustrated book? Did you know that some points have illustrations for a century ago, as well as renewed versions just a few years old? Allow yourself to listen to your favourity old stories again and again with the images portrating completely different meaning each time.

### Volume

Some users really want to be enveloped in the sounds, with the narrator barely whispering the words throughout a rainy storm. Others want to feel as if the narrator is right there next to them, with the sounds further off in the background, allowing you to focus on the words themselves. Enjamon provides this support using the custom volume mixer.
