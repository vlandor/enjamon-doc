<Title title="Translate" />

Offering the same content to those who don't have English as their first language is an important design factor of Enjamon. Enough so that it's probably a little too verbose, allowing users to select not only their prefered language but also sub-dialects of it.

This is easy to understand if you compare Arabic from the Emirates to Egypt, they might as well be separate languages. The same can be said about the different variations of English around the world.

Because of this users have the option of translating between any language and dialects, without actually having to do anything else. Users can then either use the translation as subtitles or narrate it.

## The way it works is as following:

- Find an article that you would like to share by translating it into your own language
- Select the translate option within the community menu in the player
- Select the language/dialect you are translating to and the name of the article in that language
- Start translating the language using the translator view
- Narrate the translated version *(optional)*
- Translate the title, description and tags
- Publish

## FAQ 

### My language doesn't translate well with a one to one sentence mapping. why am I limited to the same structure? 

This question is something on the back of our minds, as we know that forcing these limitations may have an impact on the translation itself. But the reason why we chose this is because it allows for some really useful / occasionally fun combinations.

For usefulness, having the same sentence and paragraph structure means the sounds and images on the original article is automatically available for every translated article. This reduces the effort needed to get a translation of a popular article to match the original, by translating an article you automatically inherit all the original goodness.

Another useful aspect not yet released is that we can play languages different to the written article. What this effectively means is we can get subtitles for free from translated articles, both ways.

And the fun idea to end on is that you can even mix and match narrations and languages with your recordings/journals. Imagine replying to an English article in Spanish, and then switch the article to the same article in Spanish and hear yourself having a full-blown Spanish conversation.
