<Title title="Journey" />

A journey can be best described as a *choose your own adventure* audio book.

A user begins by entering the initial template, and at the end of each template might be presented with the option of how the journey should progress. The method of navigation differs depending on the journeys creator. Currently we support navigation via buttons on the screen and via voice recognition commands. However many more options are in the making, from randomized dice play to deciding based on users biometrics such as their pulse.
