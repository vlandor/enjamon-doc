<PageTitle title="Templates" />

A template is a mini-article that can be inserted into any journey. This allows journeys to be quickly put together using resuable parts rather than writing and narrating it from scratch.

## To create a template:

- create a template
- write
- narrate
- sounds
- images
- publish

Once published, you can then import the template into any of your journeys, allowing you to reuse common templates multiple times.

Each template can also have multiple narrators, sound profiles and image profiles, allowing creators to select which ones work best for their specific journey.

You also have the option of publishing it publicly. A public template means other creators can find it within the template library, speeding up their journey development.
