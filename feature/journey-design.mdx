<Title title="Journey Design" />

Journeys are a graph of scenes that are linked together using conditions. A viewer then uses these conditions to select different routes and enjoy a more immersive and customized  experience.

## A typical flow for designing a journey is:

1. Create a journey

2. Add in a scene. These can either be pre-made scenes available within the scene library,
or via adding a new scene directly to the journey itself.

3. Pick the desired image/sounds available on the scene for this journey.

4. Link the scenes together. This can be done simply by just dragging lines between two scenes to create a link.

5. Once a link is created you can then decide on the conditions needed for the link to be taken. These can be either:
    - a default transition (this automatically sets the link to the default transition if no other action was taken)
    - a physical transition (this shows buttons on the player that allow the user to select where to go next)
    - a verbal transition (this allows options to be navigated to using voice recognition)

6. Repeat 2-6 until the journey is completed

7. Add journey metadata such as the title, image and outline

8. Publish!

## A few brief journey hints/limits:

### Don't add too many choices from each scene. 

This is for both the reason that all next scenes are pre-loaded so could put a bit of a strain on the network, and also because the choice is something that doesn't always positively impact users.

### Don't make scenes too long (keep each one to around 15 minutes of narration)

Think of scenes sort of like chapters in a book, it's usually best to stop at the end of a  chapter rather than a paragraph. The scenes in a journey can be linear, meaning the user doesn't have to be presented with a choice, but it would make it easier for the user to skip ahead and also reduce loading time for each scene.
