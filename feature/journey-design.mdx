<Title title="Journey Design" />

Journeys are a graph of scenes that are linked together using conditions.

### A typical flow for designing a journey is:

1. Create a journey

2. Add in a scene. These can either be pre-made scenes available within the scene library,
or via adding a new scene directly to the journey itself.

3. Pick the desired image/sounds available on the scene for this journey.

4. Link the scenes together. This can be done simply by just dragging lines between two scenes to create a link.

5. Once a link is created you can then decide on the conditions needed for the link to be taken.        
    
    These can be either:
    - default transition (this automatically sets the link to the default transition if no other action was taken)
    - physical transition (this shows buttons on the player that allow the user to select where to go next)
    - verbal transition (this allows options to be navigated to using voice recognition)

6. Repeat 2-6 until the journey is completed

7. Add journey metadata (title, image, outline)

8. Publish!

### A few brief journey hints/limits:

1. Don't add too many choices from each scene. 

    This is for both the reason that all next scenes are pre-loaded so could put a bit of a strain on the network, and also because the choice is something that doesn't always positively impact users.

2. Don't make scenes insanely long (keep each one to around 15 minutes of narration)

    Think of scenes sort of like chapters in a book, it's usually best to stop at a chapter rather than at the end of a paragraph. The scenes can be linear, meaning the user isn't presented with a choice, but it would make it easier for the user to skip ahead and also reduce loading time for each scene.
