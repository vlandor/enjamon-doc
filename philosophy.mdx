<Title title="The Enjamon Philosophy" />

The Enajmon Philosophy is based on the following ideals:

## Treat every user as an individual

This concept is why Enjamon has been made the way it is, fully customizable. From being able to pick from a large variety of topics to pick the narrator, the sounds, the images, the language and even the volume of sounds and narrators separately.

I have been asked quite a bit if this is overkill, and to be honest, I occasionally agree. But then I pick up a well-written hypnosis session, meditation or book and find myself unable to commit because the sound of the music was just too loud or upbeat/downbeat, the person's voice was just not as soothing as others found it, or because the language barrier made it hard to keep track. I wanted to find something that could allow me to select something that works.

## Community

It's great that we managed to get all the above done, but if you select an article that has only been written and narrated once none of the benefits shows up. And that's why an active community is required to help bring variety to the articles.

Creators have the option of publishing their articles publicly on the platform, in exchange for allowing other users to contribute by narrating, adding different sounds and translating to different languages. If they would rather keep their articles private they can also do so, and invite specific individuals to add any level of customization.

Any user can signup for a free account and help add content to any public article, making it very easy to create a collaborative culture.

## Interactivity

Humans love to be taken into different realities through the art of storytelling. However, the world of entertainment nowadays has been very often limited through a one-way mirror. We have access to thousands of movies, videos, books, meditations and so on, but other than the limited editions (ex. Bandersnatch on Netflix) how often do we have a say in how something can progress?

Enjamon is a unique platform that provides journeys to combine the creativity and art of storytellers and our desire to have a say in how things progress.

The range of stories this can influence is pretty large, for example:

### Meditation

Image a meditation where you can pick what you want to do and where you want to go as the journey progresses. Visit a beach where each wave makes you sink deeper into a state of relaxation, or a stream where the sound of fishing jumping in and out allows you to forgot where you are.

You can also allow the meditation to change course, if you don't find yourself at total ease then continue doing more calming exercises rather than moving into a healing section.

### Pick your adventure

Write pick your adventure books, or find your favourite (public domain) books to digitize and share online. Pick every action at the end of each page/chapter, allowing you to listen to the same story, again and again, each time with a different twist.

### Mazes

A more experimental experience, navigate through a maze using only audio and your memory. Move through the maze with left / right directions and see how close you can get to the end. Who knows, maybe you'll find a few secrets rooms on the way!

## Data insights

This final part is probably our favourite. Imagine a world where every time you meditated you would be able to have full sight of how well that meditation went. Did your stress levels go down? Have you been able to let go of all your thoughts to be present? Compare how far you have come over weeks and months by comparing your pulse and other metrics. 

Or if you are a bit more of a horror fan, record your pulse as you traverse a haunted home, and see how much your nerves have steeled over time.

Or just fill out a daily journal, with the person asking the questions being randomly chosen every day.
